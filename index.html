            <p>I like to think I'm God's gift to humanity. Guess that also says something about my modesty(or lack thereof). I would describe myself as passionate, ambitious and a true learner. I love meeting new people and (surprise) learning from them. My only other passion is music, a pursuit I have been, well, pursuing for the past 9 years. I don't really have much prior experience coding, something I regret now seeing how interesting and useful it's proving to be. All I need to transform my abstract ideas to reality can be achieved through computer code, something my tiny brain has only just realized. And that's pretty much it.
