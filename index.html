            <p>I like to think I'm God's gift to humanity. Guess that also says something about my lack of modesty. I would describe myself as passionate, ambitious and a true learner. I love meeting new people and (surprise) learning from them. My only other passion is music, a pursuit I have been, well, pursuing for the past 9 years. And that's pretty much it.
